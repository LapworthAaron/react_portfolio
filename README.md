The task was to develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site, as well as create or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers.

Remember, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished" and "professional." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
* Use mobile-first design.
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

Base Requirements
Your portfolio must meet the following requirements:
* The following technologies must be used:
    * React
    * Navigation using React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
* Your portfolio must contain the following information:
    * Your name
    * Links to your:
    * GitHub profile
    * LinkedIn page
    * Email address
    * Phone number (optional)
    * CV (in PDF format)
     * Your CV must contain up-to-date projects and professional experience
    * A list of projects (Challenges or Projects). For each project, make sure you have the following:
        * Project title
        * Link to the deployed version

* Projects page:
    * Must render six instances of the Project component dynamically
